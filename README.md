# To-Do List Application (C#)

This is a simple console-based To-Do list application built with C#. It allows users to add, view, mark as complete, and save tasks to a file. This is my **first C# project**, designed to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, file handling, and user input processing.

## Features

• **Add a task**: Add a task with a name and due date.  
• **View tasks**: Display all tasks with their completion status and due date.  
• **Mark task as completed**: Mark tasks as complete once done.  
• **Save tasks**: Automatically saves tasks to a file so they persist between sessions.  
• **Load tasks**: Loads tasks from a file when the program starts.
